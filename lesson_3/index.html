				is an
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_metal" target="_blank"> extreme </a> subgenre of heavy metal
				music.
				Building from the musical structure of thrash metal and early black metal, death metal emerged during the
				mid-1980s.[6]
				Bands such as Venom, Celtic Frost, Slayer, and Kreator were important influences on the genre's
				creation.[7][8][9]
				Possessed,[10] Death,[11] Necrophagia,[12] Obituary,[13] Autopsy,[14] and Morbid Angel[15] are often considered
				pioneers
				of the genre. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, death metal gained more media attention as a popular genre.
				Niche
				record labels like Combat, Earache, and Roadrunner began to sign death metal bands at a rapid rate.[16]

				English extreme metal band <a class="link" href="#"> Venom </a>, from Newcastle, crystallized the elements of
				what later became known as thrash metal, death metal and black metal, with their first two albums Welcome to
				Hell[18] and Black Metal,[19] released in
				late 1981 and 1982, respectively. Their dark, blistering sound, harsh vocals, and macabre, proudly Satanic
				imagery proved a major inspiration for extreme metal bands.[20] Another highly influential band, Slayer, formed
				in 1981. Although the band was

				a band that formed in the San Francisco Bay Area during 1983, is described by
				Allmusic as "connecting the
				dots" between thrash metal and death metal with their 1985 debut album, Seven Churches.[26] While attributed
				as having a Slayer influence,[27] current and former members of the band had actually cited Venom and Motörhead,
				as well as early
				"the likes of Trey Azagthoth and Morbid Angel based what they were doing in their formative years on the
				Possessed blueprint laid down on the legendary Seven Churches recording.

					Possessed arguably did more to further the cause

					'Death Metal' than any of the early acts on the scene back in the mid-late 80's."
					During the same period as the dawn of Possessed, a second influential metal band was formed in Orlando,
					Florida.
					Originally called Mantas, Death was formed in 1983 by Chuck Schuldiner, Kam Lee, and Rick Rozz. Inspired by

				By 1989, many bands had been signed by eager record labels wanting to cash in on the subgenre, including
				Florida's
				Obituary, Morbid Angel and Deicide.[40] This collective of death metal bands hailing from Florida are often
				labeled as
				"Florida death metal". Morbid Angel pushed the genre's limits both musically and lyrically, with the release of
				their
				debut album Altars of Madness in 1989.[41][42] The album "redefined what it meant to be heavy while influencing
				an
				upcoming class of brutal death metal."[43]

				Death metal's popularity achieved its initial peak during 1992–1993, with some bands such as Morbid Angel and
